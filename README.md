 * `prolate_Hongyu_classA.pdf`: Images, velocity and dispersion maps for the 38 galaxies with minor-axis rotation found in Li et al. (2017, in prep). The figure labels are the same as in Li et al. (2017, in prep)
 * `prolate_Hongyu_classB.pdf`: Images, velocity and dispersion maps for the possiable cases mentioned in Li et al. (2017, in prep). Note that the classB sample are not included in the study in Li et al. (2017, in prep).
 * `table_pro.dat`: Properties of the 38 galaxies with minor-axis rotation. The columns are: (1)MaNGA ID (2) RA (3)DEC (4)Stellar mass (5) Average sruface brightness (6) SDSS g-i color gradient (7) Ellipticity (8) Angular momentum parameter (9) effective radius Re_maj (10) Enclosed total mass within the 3D half-light ratius.
 * `table_ctr_all.dat`: Properties of the galaxies in the control M^*_{ALL} sample. The columns are the same as in table_pro.dat
 * `table_ctr_sr.dat`: Properties of the galaxies in the control M^*_{SR} sample. The columns are the same as in table_pro.dat
 * `table_ctr_fr.dat`: Properties of the galaxies in the control M^*_{FR} sample. The columns are the same as in table_pro.dat
